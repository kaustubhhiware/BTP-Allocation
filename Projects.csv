On Goodreads website, users can add books to their personal bookshelves for reading, track the status of their readings and post a reading status, find which books their friends and favorite authors are reading, participate in discussions and take part in group activities on various topics, and, as well, get personalized book recommendations. Further, Goodreads provides a platform for social interactions among users; once an user adds another user as a friend, one can view his/her friends’ shelves and reviews and comment on friends’ pages. In this project, we shall analyze the social book-reading behavior of the users and how such reading behavior influence the engagement of various entities on the Goodreads platform. We have already crawled a huge data of ~50 million Goodreads user statuses that can be readily used for analysis purpose."

People anonymously ask questions related to their personal life, or seek knowledge about things that they can't ask in public. Quora is a fast growing Q&A site that provides this useful feature to its users. A user is allowed to ask questions as well as answer to them anonymously.The goal of this research is to study the following:
(a) The characteristics of anonymous contents across different topics in Quora. (b) Why do some users post their answers as anonymous, while other don't. Is there any difference in their answers?
(c) Do anonymous answers receive more upvotes/views? We would also like to develop an anonymity score which would give a value between 0 and 1 depending on the text content and topics."
9,AM3,Animesh Mukherjee,AM,,Learning network embeddings in noisy incomplete graphs,"Network embedding, deep learning",1,Any,"A prediction task on a graph can be of two types. It can be node based i.e we are trying to predict the labels of a set of unknown nodes, given that we know the exact labels of a fraction of the dataset. As an example in a social network dataset, we may be interested in understanding the interests of a node based on its peers. It can also be edge based i.e. we are interested in predicting links between two nodes, as an example in a collaboration network we may be interested in predicting future collaborations between two researchers.
In either of the tasks we are required to represent the training examples as feature vectors which is extremely time consuming, requires domain knowledge and it is not generalizable.
In this project our objective is to investigate techniques for automatically generating ""deep"" features for representing nodes. We will explore existing state-of-the-art methods, where representation of a node is learned by optimising an objective function. This function ensures that the features generated for a node is consistent with that of its neighbours and hence the neighbourhood is preserved. We will look into how different definitions of neighbourhood
and fluctuations in node properties affect the generated feature vector and the accumulated effect on the prediction accuracy. See for example a working system here: snap.stanford.edu/node2vec"
10,AM4,Animesh Mukherjee,AM,,Understanding Network Robustness against random and targeted attacks,Network Science,1,Any,"An important aspect in the study of complex system is to understand the effect of failure of the individual components on the performance of the whole networked system. The detailed motivation for studying this effect depends on the particular networked system under consideration. As an example, it is important to know how the failure of individual routers in the Internet affects the overall function of the network. Similarly, if the network in question is a contact network on which a disease can spread, then it is critical to understand how the
effective removal of vertices from the network (e.g. through vaccination) affects the spread of the disease.
In this project our primary objective is to understand how network metrics which quantify robustness is affected by various types of attacks i.e both uniform and targeted. We will look at measures based on connectivity, distance including reliability polynomials. We will also consider metrics based on spectral property of the graphs i.e. metrics which are function of the eigenvalue of the modified graph adjacency matrix. We will apply these techniques on novel real world datasets and based on our observations we will propose algorithms which
can increase resilience of vulnerable networks"

12,BM1,Bivas Mitra,BM,,Community detection in Multilayer Social networks ,Social Networks ,1,Any,"Classically, social relationships are represented as networks; for instance Facebook friendship network, Twitter follow network etc. Interestingly, real networks are becoming increasingly dependent on one another. Nodes in this kind of interacting networks can be interdependent, and in this case the function or activity of a node in one network layer depends on the activity of the nodes in another network layer. For example, in Facebook, other than friendship, we can find relations like who-messages-whom, who-shares-what etc. To represent such complex relationships, we take help of multilayer networks. In this project, we want to detect communities in such multilayer networks. Community detection is a standard problem to detect cohesive groups in a network. However, investigating community structure in complex multilayer networks is a challenging task. This project aims to propose new algorithms to detect communities in generic multilayer networks and new metrics to measure quality of such communities. The evaluation of the algorithm with be performed through empirical and synthetic dataset and suitable recommendation systems will be built as an application of the algorithm. "

Some cascades are formed within a very short time period. They exhibit a “quick rise-and-fall” pattern forming bursts. Essentially, burst is a large number of retweets of a particular tweet occurring within a certain short time window. The occurrence of a burst indicates the original tweet receives abnormally high attentions during the burst period.  In this project, we aim to address the question ""can we detect, model and predict the burst during information spreading?"" The vast difference in magnitude and time span of the cascades makes extracting comparable features difficult, and results in building predictive models challenging."

It can help in different areas ranging from automatic stress detection to sharing emotion states automatically over OSN like Facebook. But identifying different emotion states accurately with minimal user intervention is a challenge, which can be alleviated by monitoring user's smart devices (smartphone, smart watch, wrist bands etc.) usage details. For example, these explorations may reveal that when a user feels happy, she calls some group of people or uses specific types of applications.  The major objective of this project is to identify such cues from smart device (smartphones, wearable sensors) usage patterns and build a machine learning based emotion detection model. The model is planned to be supervised, so it will also employ a sophisticated ground truth collection mechanism by opportunistically asking user to label her current emotion state. "

In this project, we investigate an important, but currently neglected property of human behavior to improve the existing models of activity recognition. Within large populations, communities of socially connected individuals (IoT) often have correlated behavioral patterns. Such observations present a significant opportunity to improve the recognition of activities, as the inferences about one individual can be leveraged to improve the inferences made about others with whom they are socially connected.

In case of retweet, information is simply relayed to all the followers of the retweeting user. However, mention utility allows to spread an information far beyond the neighborhood and improves its visibility by making it available to the appropriate set of users.  In this project, we aim to investigate the impact of mentioning on tweet virality. We want to model tweet propagation dynamics and develop a real time mention recommendation system for Twitter.

AES is a 128-bit block cipher with a variable key length (128, 192, and 256-bit keys are supported). Designed in 1997, AES has survived numerous cryptanalytic efforts. Though many papers have been published on the cryptanalysis of AES, the fastest single-key attacks on round-reduced AES variants so far are only slightly more powerful than those proposed 15 years ago. For all versions of AES, the number of cryptanalyzed rounds did not increase, till date it is achieved 7 rounds for AES-128 and 8 rounds for both AES-192 and AES-256. However, a decrease in the computational complexity of the key recovery was achieved, though it is very far from practical. As for now, there are no known practical attacks that work on full-round AES. 
In this scenario, this project aims to develop new cryptanalysis techniques and as well as to implement practical attacks on round-reduced AES."
26,DRC2,Dipanwita Roy Chowdhury,DRC,,"Attacks on Authenticated Encryption Schemes, the Phase III Candidates of Caesar Competition",Cryptography,1,Any,"Authenticated Encryption provides encryption and authentication simultaneously. The potentially relevant cryptanalysis techniques for AES-based authenticated encryption (AE) are differential and linear cryptanalysis, since these techniques are general, powerful, and prevalent. Resistance against these techniques should result in resistance against many other less general techniques. A fundamental requirement of symmetric-key cryptosystem design is to prove resistance to differential cryptanalysis.   There are a number of variants of differential cryptanalysis like Truncated and Higher-Order Differentials, XL and XSL Attacks, Algebraic attacks, which have been successfully exploited on AES-based AE schemes that were fully or partially broken. 
This project focuses on analyzing AE schemes by exploiting some variants of the Differential Attack. We also aim to develop a generalized scheme using the same techniques for practically attacking AES based AE schemes or the winner of Caesar Competition."

We need next generation of cryptographic algorithms, the systems that resist quantum-computer attacks: in particular, post-quantum public-key encryption systems and post-quantum public-key signature systems. Solutions can be of hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography. Mathematical foundations as well as implementation issues have to be explored. This project aims to design new primitives for the field of post-quantum cryptography.

It is a very useful resource to extract information from the conversation of a group of people. Detection of a topic/story(which could be a collection of tweets which may or may not contain a hashtag) online  and understanding how they are evolving or dying over time is a very interesting study.  It is very often observed that many people are talking about some important event without using any hashtag initially. With the popularity of the story, some hashtags might get introduced sometimes. Apart from bundling tweets to detect a story, predicting how this cluster of tweets will gain popularity in future is extremely useful in many aspects. For example, on an event like BigBillionDay on an e-commerce, people start tweeting if they find any technical difficulties on buying any product. If this story/topic can be detected beforehand and the popularity could be predicted then this issues could be addressed immediately."

Variants of either flooding or random walk form the basis of such information dissemination algorithms. While flooding achieves maximum coverage in minimum time bandwidth is very high. Similarly for random walk the wastage is minimum and also the network coverage. We plan to propose a spreading algorithm which achieves higher coverage and at the same time consumes lesser bandwidth.

We use different modes of transport in our daily lives and often face different issues related with traffic, poor road condition, overcrowding etc. These situations generate various negative emotions among us and create different risks for us. For example, a highly crowded route often generates anger and frustration and can make the user impatient. On the contrary, soetimes we spend reasonable amount of time while having a smooth comfortable ride. This can effectivey be used in performing some todos to manage time better. In this project, we investigate both of these extremes and develop an Android based application, which (a) reads data from different onboard sensors present in smart devices (b) determines current mode of transport (c) senses traffic conditions (e.g. congested), road condition (e.g. jerky, too many bumps), bus type (ac or non-ac), user context (e.g. sitting or standing, probability to get a seat) automatically (d) determine various user's activities to infer user's emotion state. Once the emotion state is identified, the app recommends to utilize the time in more effective way (e.g recommend listening music to get rid of negative emotions, remind in doing various todos, when having a smooth comfortable ride)."

We plan to develop a Telepresence Recording Studio for various human activities (physical, visual, auditory, vibrational, optical, and the like) with high precision and proper synchronisation between multiple sensors. To setup the studio different groups of sensors will be experimented with so that various combinations of cost, effectiveness and multi-modality can be explored. Finally, simple demonstrative solutions will be built on them to assess the effectiveness of the Studio."

The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength of membership of a vertex to a community depends upon the following two factors: (i) the distribution of external connectivity of the vertex to individual communities and not the total external connectivity, and (ii) the strength of its internal connectivity and not just the total internal edges. 
We study some theoretical problems related to this new parameter."

In this project we look at sparse efficient representation learning for text mining applications like Named Entity Disambiguation.
68,SB2,Sourangshu Bhattacharya,SB,,Named Entity Disambiguation using Representation Learning,Machine Learning / NLP,1,Any,"Web pages, news articles, blog postings, and other Internet data contain mentions of named entities such as people, places, organizations, etc. Names are often ambiguous: the same name can have many different meanings. For example, given a text like “They performed Kashmir, written by Page and Plant. Page played unusual chords on his Gibson.”, how can we tell that “Kashmir” denotes a song by Led Zeppelin and not the Himalaya region(and that Page refers to guitarist Jimmy Page and not to Google founder Larry Page, and that Gibson is a guitar model rather than the actor Mel Gibson). Disambiguating named entities in natural language text means mapping mentions of ambiguous names onto canonical entities like people or places, registered in a knowledge base such as DBpedia,Freebase,YAGO. 
Now, we are posing this Named Entity Disambiguation problem as large scale multitask learning where each task output class range is several entities specified for a mention. And each mention will create each task. So if we have a specific article, we have to map every mention to an entity simultaneously. If we want to solve this problem in a limited RAM, we have to reduce the dimension of the data. Dimension Reduction can be done via many types of random projection. Or we can learn the representation in the reduced space via representation learning. "
69,SB3,Sourangshu Bhattacharya,SB,,Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication in Spark for Rectangular Matrices,Big Data / Numerical Computation,1,Any,"Matrix multiplication is found to be an essential tool for many practical applications. Numerical weather prediction is one such application which requires numerical techniques like interpolation and aggregation that act on large climatic datasets containing thousands of points with spatial and temporal attributes. Interpolation methods like Ordinary Kriging, Thin Plate Spline require multiplications of matrices of large cardinalities and therefore cannot be computed on a single machine for time and space bottleneck. So, there is an urgent need for the implementation of these matrix operations in a distributed setting for easy and faster execution of the interpolation methods. Strassen’s matrix multiplication algorithm is a fast matrix multiplication algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^{2.8}) compared to naïve implementation having a time complexity of O(n^3) where nxn is the size of the matrices. The divide and conquer nature of the algorithm provides a sound setting for implementing it in a distributed framework like Spark. Spark has emerged as a large scale data processing engine with a dedicated machine learning library (MLLib) for processing large matrices. Though the problem of multiplying two matrices having size 2^n has been well explored in the literature, there is still a scope to implement its rectangular version in Spark framework.
The project comprises two steps. The first step is to implement the rectangular version of the algorithm and the second version is to compare the results with the latest multiplication implementation of MLLib."

Of these major topics, we are working on the Music Project, broadly on computational musicology, based on Indian Classical Music (ICM) and its applications.
Our aim is twofold: a)To understand the deep structures of the Raga system of Indian Classical Music. b)To find patterns in the way audience responds when exposed to Indian Classical Music.
In the Indian musical tradition, ragas are associated with different times of the day, seasons, different emotions and moods. In this project, we are trying to understand the deep meaning of the ragas, why they are categorized in the way they are. What intrinsic property of each raga comprises the “raganess” of the raga? Experts of ICM are able to recognize each raga by listening to it only for a few seconds. How are they able to do this? This leads to a very interesting problem of Raga classification – a very well-known problem in this domain. A number of studies have already been undertaken on this topic, using various methods like SVM, KNN etc.
By listening to some ragas, we immediately feel sad/happy/other emotions (eg. Listen to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4glNhNvMYU the tune evokes a sense of sadness). Why is this so? Is it because of the sequence of notes used, the phrases of notes aligned one after the other, or is it some forgotten deeper structure intrinsic to the raga used: Shivaranjani. This leads to the problem of emotion identification from ICM clips. We work on the possible emotions that can be generated by ICM clips, their representation, to ultimately predict from a provided clip, the emotion it might elicit."

72,SC2,Sandip Chakraborty,SC,,QoS based Network Resource Management To Cater to Dynamic Workload Mobility in Hyperconverged Architecture,Systems,1,Any,"Current Hyperconverged (HC) environments are predominantly used for workloads such as virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). However, HC architecture is set to evolve towards support for diverse enterprise applications with varying workload characteristics and associated scalability. This consequentially drives workload mobility requirements for optimal application workload placement on the HC nodes for efficient resource utilization, or workload migration for Business Continuity. Workload mobility is a key requirement in Data Centers for optimal workload placement and Business Continuity. Mobility of workloads, exemplarily VMs, can broadly cover (1) live migration of workloads, and (2) mobility triggered for optimal workload placement for efficient resource use For meeting the above requirements, dynamic resource management in hyper-convergence architecture, considering application performance and QoS simultaneously, is a challenging task. As new or varying intensity workloads demand for resources based on their service level agreements (SLA), the task is to optimally redistribute and schedule the resources with minimal impact over the performance of existing systems.
